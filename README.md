# Netflix-iOS-clone

This iOS app is developed using Swift UIKit programmatically(No storyboard). Here I have used TMDB API services to get the data of the trending movies,tvs and other upcoming stuffs .

I have used the MVVM architechtural pattern for this app based on the complexity and the pages of the application .

TabViewcontroller,tableViews and collection views are been used a lot in the design .And on clicking the any particular movie ,we can navigate to the webview where we can watch the trailer and description and its been done using Webkit. 

It also has a advanced SearchFilter feature .

And lastly for persistance , I have used coredata , where the downloaded movies/trailers are stored and can be deleted also.
